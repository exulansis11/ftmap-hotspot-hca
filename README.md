Reproducible pipeline for hierarchical clustering of FTMap-derived protein hotspots using PyMOL/XDrugPy

# FTMap Hotspot HCA Pipeline

This repository contains a set of Python scripts for the hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of protein binding hotspots generated by **FTMap**, using **PyMOL** and the **XDrugPy** plugin.

The pipeline was designed to perform **reproducible, interpretable, and publication-oriented hotspot similarity analyses**, focusing on spatial and functional relationships between binding hotspots.

## 🔬 Implemented Analyses

The following analyses are implemented as independent scripts:

- **Hotspot Overlap (HO)**  
  Spatial similarity between hotspots based on probe overlap.

- **Residue Jaccard Similarity**  
  Functional similarity based on shared protein residues.

- **Residue Overlap Similarity**  
  Core functional overlap between hotspot regions.

- **Multivariate Euclidean HCA**  
  Clustering based on combined hotspot properties (S0, CD, MD).

Each analysis produces a dendrogram suitable for interpretation and publication.
